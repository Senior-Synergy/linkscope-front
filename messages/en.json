                    "The Random Forest algorithm can be utilized to enhance accuracy and mitigate overfitting in URL classification. The algorithm combines the outputs of multiple decision trees to categorize URLs. By using random subsets of features, each decision tree focuses on different combinations of URL features. The diverse set of decision trees creates a robust ensemble model that effectively analyzes and classifies URLs. A final decision is made through majority voting based on the predictions from each tree, resulting in more reliable and precise classifications compared to a single decision tree model."

By eliminating/reducing irrelevant and redundant features, feature selection could reduce the number of features, shorten the training time, simplify the learned classifiers, and/or improve the classification performance.",

PSO simulates social behavior such as birds flocking and fish schooling. In PSO, a population, also called a swarm, of candidate solutions are encoded as particles in the search space. PSO starts with the random initialisation of a population of particles. Particles move in the search space to search for the optimal solution by updating the position of each particle based on the experience of its own.",
